# ShareClassWeb

ShareClass is a platform that provides an alternative to Classroom Google, where the main goal is to facilitate the exchange of homework solutions between students. The users are able to create class-rooms and manage them, add homework assignments with a title/description/due date, and publish/view solutions to the homework assignments. The class-rooms can be joined by invitation only.

Only the administrators, who are the creators of the class-rooms, are able to add homework assignments, while all members of the class-room can add solutions to the homework assignments.
